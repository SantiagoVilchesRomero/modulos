                Known as ‘The Everest of cave diving’, Eagle's Nest is a submerged cave system in Florida that attracts
                some of the world's most experienced cave divers. The system is notorious for its extreme depths, narrow
                passages and challenging visibility conditions. These expeditions are not formal competitions, but
                exploration and study missions in which new areas of the caves are mapped, species are studied and
                findings are shared with the scientific and diving community.

                The cenotes of the Yucatan Peninsula are home to some of the most extensive and beautiful underwater

                dedicated to exploring, mapping and documenting the cave networks. Divers from all over the world have
                participated in the project, and each year new routes and connections between caves are discovered. The
                aim is to preserve these natural spaces and to encourage scientific research into the unique ecosystems
                found in them.

                gather at a different venue to compete in a series of distance flying races. Events may include
                point-to-point flights, triangular courses or endurance tests, and pilots must plan their routes using
                thermal currents to maximise flight time. The championship is a showcase for the skill and strategy of
                the pilots, who must adapt to the flying conditions and plot efficient routes to win.

                their flight strategy and physical endurance in mountainous terrain. It is a test of strength, endurance
                and navigational skill.
