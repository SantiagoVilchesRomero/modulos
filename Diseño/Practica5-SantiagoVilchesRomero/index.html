                <span class="bold">Iceland, a land of dramatic landscapes and deep history</span>. The first settlers,
                <span class="bold">Norse Vikings</span>, arrived in
                the late 9th century, bringing their rich culture and establishing the first settlements. Over the
                centuries, Iceland endured <span class="bold">harsh climates</span> and isolation, yet developed a
                strong tradition of <span class="bold">saga writing</span>
                and storytelling. In the 13th century, Iceland became part of the Norwegian Crown, later
                transitioning to Danish rule. In 1944, it achieved <span class="bold">full independence</span>, becoming
                a republic. The country has since embraced its <span class="bold">geothermal energy</span> and <span
                    class="bold">unique heritage</span>, balancing modern advancements with the

                    <h4>The Elves and the Huldufólk (Hidden People)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Icelandic folklore tells of elves and the mysterious huldufólk, invisible beings said to live in
                        hills, rocks, and remote landscapes. They are believed to have their own society and must be
                        treated with respect. Many stories involve construction projects mysteriously failing near rocks
                        inhabited by these hidden beings. Even today, some Icelanders consult folklore experts before
                        building in certain areas.

                    <p>
                        Gryla, a fearsome giantess, is the mother of the 13 mischievous Yule Lads. During Christmas,
                        Gryla is said to descend from the mountains to capture misbehaving children and cook them in her
                        cauldron. The Yule Lads, however, are pranksters who visit homes during the holiday season,
                        leaving small gifts or punishments (like rotten potatoes) depending on children’s behavior.

                    <p>
                        In Lake Lagarfljót, a legendary serpentine monster known as the "Lagarfjótsormur" is said to
                        reside. The tale tells of a young girl who threw a golden ring into the lake, hoping to increase
                        its magic. Instead, a small creature grew into a terrifying beast. There have been numerous
                        sightings of this monster, often compared to the famous Loch Ness Monster.

                <p>
                    Discover New Zealand's fascinating Maori history, full of intrigue and
                    resilience. More than 1,000 years ago, the Maori arrived here in canoes
                    from the Pacific Islands, establishing a unique culture. With the arrival of
                    Europeans in the 17th century, conflicts and tensions over control of the
                    land erupted, culminating in the Land War in the 19th century. However,
                    in the late 20th century, Maori began a cultural renaissance, fighting for
                    their rights and revitalising their language and traditions. New Zealand's
                    Maori history is a testament to the resilience and determination of a
                    people who have left an indelible mark on the country's identity and
                    culture.

                    Discover New Zealand's incredible wildlife with three animal highlights.
                    The kiwi, a nocturnal, flightless bird with a long curved beak, is known for
                    its quiet demeanour and ability to sniff out food underground. The kakapo,
                    a nocturnal parrot and the world's heaviest parrot, is flightless and
                    surprisingly flies in its sleep. The tuatara, a prehistoric reptile, is found only
                    in New Zealand and can live more than 100 years. With its unique
                    appearance and a transparent third "skin" over its eyes, the tuatara is a true
                    treasure. These iconic animals represent the diversity and beauty of New
                    Zealand's wildlife.

                    Discover New Zealand's impressive flora through three outstanding
                    specimens. The kauri, a monumental tree endemic to the north of the
                    country, can reach heights of over 50 metres and live for over 1,000 years.
                    Flax, known as harakeke in Maori, is a versatile plant that has been used for
                    centuries by Maori to make baskets, clothing and rope. The pohutukawa,
                    also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, is noted for its vibrant red
                    flowers that bloom during the summer. This tree is a symbol of New
                    Zealand's culture and natural beauty. These three specimens represent
